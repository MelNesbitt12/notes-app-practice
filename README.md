# Notes App - Practice with Vanilla JS

This basic notes app allows a user to create and edit notes in the browser!

This app was perfect for my continued practice with Javascript modules, event listeners, creating classes with constructors, and styling with Sass.

I also used NPM to install the following dependencies:
- Babel:
  - babel-core
  - babel-loader
  - babel-preset-env
  - babel-polyfill
- Html-webpack-plugin
- Css-loader
- Sass:
  - sass-loader
  - style-loader
- Webpack:
  - webpack
  - webpack-cli
  - webpack-dev-server

## Future Iterations:
- Allowing users to save their notes via local storage

## Technologies Used:
- Javascript
- Sass

## Getting Started:
- fork and clone
- run `npm install`
- run `npm run start` to start the development server
